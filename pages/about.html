                    <p>As 3 young women living in the present world, we have realized the everyday
                        problems of millions of women. Come, we seem to think about it hardly, in practice we always get
                        the same question „What will I wear?” Sometimes we have the whole morning for it, sometimes we
                        think about it in the shower. However, there are times when there is neither time nor idea. By
                        creating Set The Label, we meet such women and we want to help by offering sets of clothes
                        perfect for almost any occasion. Nowadays, it is very important to have at least one top or
                        one
                        pair of pants that match almost everything that will make us feel very comfortable and also
                        confident in our own body.</p>
                </div>

                    <h2 class="section-h2">CREATED WITH PASSION</h2>
                    <p>Set The Label was created as a school project, which in conjunction with
                        passion and commitment turned into the idea of creating a new clothes brand. The project is
                        authored by three girls who together form a great team that, in addition to the usual sale
                        of
                        clothes, wants to offer women something unique. The main assumption of the company is
                        designing
                        sets of clothes that can be easily combined with other clothes that we already have in the
                        closet. In this way, we want to help women save those precious „5 minutes in the morning”,
                        which
                        often prove necessary for us.</p>

                <div class="title_and_text_equality">
                    <h2 class="section-h2">EQUALITY ABOVE ALL</h2>
                    <p class="paragraph_quality">In addition to creating comfortable and good-looking clothes, the
                        premise of Set The Label is also to get rid of a mistaken vision about the female body.
                        Campaigns of famous brands very often present us with a false image of the female body,
                        which
                        only creates negative thoughts and introduces into complexes. We want to move away from such
                        thinking and present the philosophy that every woman is just as beautiful regardless of her
                        figure. We hope that in this way we can at least slightly increase women’s self-acceptance
                        and
                        strengthen their sense of beauty.</p>
